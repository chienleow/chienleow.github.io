I was a sales analyst at a local e-commerce company here in Minnesota. I came across coding languages about 2 years ago, when I wanted to explore my career options, I was looking into SEO, data science and eventually landed on some computer science free lectures and resources. I was mesmerized by the fact that our future language is going to be a coding language. I have always loved creating things, from hands on arts to video production. Realizing that I can use my creativity and passion for new creations on technology has eventually brought me here today. All the well-prepared resources and motivating testimonies I found on the internet has completely demolished my previous long-held perceptions that computer science is meant for men who are good in math and sciences. Some of my biggest inspirations have been ted talks about computer science and podcasts by women in tech and minority in tech, for example "Learn to Code With Me by Laurence Bradford" and "CodeNewbie by Saron Yitbarek".
