*What was the most adventurous thing you have done so far?* I would say enrolling in Flatiron coding bootcamp, quitting my full time job, moving 800 miles to another state to **CHANGE THINGS**. 

I was a sales analyst at an e-commerce business. I came across coding languages about 3 years ago, when I wanted to explore my career options, I looked into SEO, data science and eventually landed on some computer science free lectures and resources. I was mesmerized by the fact that our future language is going to be a coding language. 

I have always loved creating things, from hands on arts to video production. Realizing that I could use my creativity and passion for new creations on technology has eventually brought me here today. All the well-prepared resources and motivating testimonies I found on the internet has completely demolished my previous long-held perceptions that computer science is meant for men who are good in math and sciences. Some of my biggest inspirations have been ted talks about computer science and podcasts by women in tech and minority in tech, for example "Learn to Code With Me by Laurence Bradford" and "CodeNewbie by Saron Yitbarek".

*Is programming challenging?* 
It definitely is, there were many days when I doubted my drastic decisions above, 
but programming has changed the way I view trials, 
programming has changed the way I approach problems, 
programming has changed the way I ask questions, 
programming has taught me to ask better questions, 
programming has taught me to be humble, 
programming has taught me that I need a solid community more than ever, 
programming has given me this new lens to see life, 
**programming has changed my life**. :)
