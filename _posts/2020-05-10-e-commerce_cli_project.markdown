When I was brainstorming ideas for my first ever coding project, I thought of creating something that I am passionate about, which is an e-commerce app. With my previous experience in the e-commerce industry, I am aware of the reality that e-commerce is growing rapidly in the past few years and will continue developing. I am keen to provide an app with easy navigation and reliable information that will benefit the e-commerce sellers especially small business owners.

I found myself in a clueless position when first planning my CLI project. I had decided to learn and use an API for my project. API was completely new to me as the labs I had just finished were all about scraping and the videos I watched on Learn Instruct were mostly about scraping as well. These are a few tips that got me through the process.

**1. Start with Planning**

* Writing a user story and mapping out a flow diagram
* Sketch out your program in English in a text file
* Consulting your notes along the way



**2. Write the Code You Wish You Had**

* Start somewhere, even if it is just pseudo-coding
* That first step takes a lot of courage, it is normal to feel unprepared and lost

**3. Make Errors**

Get your brain running and do not be afraid to make errors
Tech is such a unique space where you are encouraged to make errors first, then go from there.

**4. Think Separation of Concerns**

* Start with your "Classes", code the big picture, then fill in the details
* Class CLI - the controller that communicates with my user
* Class Object (in my case, its "Category" and "Listing") - where objects are created and stored for user display/usage
* Class API - bring in the external API here, instantiate my objects

**5. Reach Out & Befriend Someone**

* Reach out for help, join slack channel #cli-data-gem-project, there is no such thing as a silly question.
* Go to [study groups/office hours](http://learn.co/study-groups) organized by section leads.


**6. Have LOTS of fun!**

* Make this app your own, have some fun with it, I feel empowered when I got to customize my very own app.
* I used the [colorize](http://rubygems.org/gems/colorize/versions/0.8.1) gem, not only it helps readability, I had lots of fun adding colors to the lines I displayed to my user.

Last but not least, I couldn't be more thankful for the fellow Flatiron students, I wouldn't survive till first project without the kindness and patience of your guidance and advice. :)
