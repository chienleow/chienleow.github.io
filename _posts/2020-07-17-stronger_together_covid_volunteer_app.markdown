While they are some larger volunteer match websites out there, my app was created specifically for local businesses and non-profit organizations in the midst of pandemic. Local businesses need help to restart their businesses or change the way they do business now with the covid restrictions. Non-profit organizations need help more than ever to meet the needs of the community.


**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**

I created 2 models, Users (Business/Non-profits) and Projects. Users can sign up for a profile with their business/non-profit name, description, email and password. When a user is signed up and signed in, user can create project(s) they need volunteers for. User can *CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete)* create new projects, read the existing projects of theirs or others, update or delete the project(s) they created. A volunteer or any viewer do not need to sign up for an account to view all the volunteer projects.


**Stretch Goals (Something I might come back and build in the future):**
- Display a list of volunteer projects based on date and time
- Another model: Volunteers
- The volunteer project page can be filtered by location, date, time etc.
- Send Reminder for volunteers
- Local businesses and non-profit organizations and volunteers can both give each other reviews, comments, ratings
